This was my first multiclass coding project using SFML libraries to learn more about coding fundamentals using C++. My childhood and current interest in Star Wars (the original trilogoy) was the inspiration for making this a game where the player is on a speeder bike travelling through the dense forrest of Endor trying to avoid getting shot at by enemy troopers.

# Development #
The game is comprised of a handful of classes to manage the background, the sprites ( the character ), and player input.

# Game Cut Scene #

The game cut scene was made entirely from scratch using GIMP, an open source image editor, and stitching it together in a timely and orderly fashion for presentation. A couple elements of this were fun to create.

#### Warp Speed ###
The warp speed scene is done by first randomly generating the position of a <code> sf::VertexArray </code>
